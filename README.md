# Halobject
##The Simulation of Halobject in Simulator Gazebo.

##The Simulation Model for Halobject_SIM.zip (With literature in Folder Related Documentations, ControllerModelSimulink for control, Gazebo model in Hal_ws.zip and description pdfs);

##The Hal_ws.zip is another copy of Gazebo model, although it is already included in Halobject_SIM.zip;

##The scanned DesignÂ Description in Dutch is in Document_Scan_Halobject.pdf;

##A prerequisite is the plug-ins ros_control and hector_ros_sonar(hector plug-in is also in this folder for convenience).

##For launching procedures, please read the instruction pdf.

##Other folders like 'hector_xxx_xxx' is folked from hector plugin series created by TU Darmstadt. It is a copy in case the file changes, and the useful part in this case is the hector_sonar in 'hector_gazebo_plugins'.

##For any other information, please don't hesitate contact me by 490685180@qq.com (A permanent personal email)

#Good Luck!
